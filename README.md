PURPOSE
Although it may look like the name of a magical Westerosi dragon princess, Ehseesi is actually a specialized search engine! Pronounced “ay see see”, Ehseesi  aims to provide sports fans of ACC schools with information on where to watch games and competitions. Inspired by occasional difficulty in finding where to watch Tar Heel basketball games, we hope to create a menu-based search utility that locates TV listings and online streams for all available games.

If it becomes a long-term project, Ehseesi will ideally implement natural language processing and wide-ranging web crawling capabilities to find live-streams of all sorts. Sporting events will take priority, however, due to the fact that they are an unusually time-sensitive category of media.

SCOPE
A search engine? Sounds complicated. For the purpose of this class (Information Science 560), though, we’ll try and keep this ambitious sounding project simple. We will eliminate the need for natural language processing by using a simple form with drop-down menus and checkboxes to accept user input. The first drop down menu will list all 25 ACC sports. The second will list all 15 ACC member schools. The checkboxes will be optional, listing different types of media (TV, radio, online video stream, online radio, gamecast) that the user can choose if they want to narrow their search.

We will want to create our own database at first, using data from theacc.com or ESPN.com.


PLAN FOR DISPERSAL AND REUSE
Our repo is freely available under the MIT license. Anybody can use our code as long as they attribute us. Our program, if successful, will prove useful to fans of Atlantic Coast Conference schools. In the long-term, the program could become useful to anybody looking for livestreaming sporting events or television shows. Google is surprisingly bad at finding such media. By focusing narrowly on a specific kind of media, Ehseesi could differentiate itself from existing search options. There are legal and illegal sources from which stream lists can be compiled. Ehseesi would bring the two types together in a single place.
